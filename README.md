Once you've made your great commits (include tests, please):

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a topic branch - `git checkout -b my_branch`
3. Push to your branch - `git push origin my_branch`
4. Create a pull request

That's it!

Please respect the indentation rules and code style. And use 2 spaces, not tabs. And don't touch the version thing or distribution files; this will be made when a new version is going to be released.
